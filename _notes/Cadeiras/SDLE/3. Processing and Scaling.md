# Processing and Scaling

## Threads
About [[Threads]]:
	→ Kernel-level Threads
	→ User-level Threads
	→ Difference between both
	→ Multi-thread Server
	→ Thread Pools

## Synchronous vs Aynchronous
Differences between [[Synchronous]] *I/O*  and [[Asynchronous]] *I/O*.
An alternative to Synchronous and Asynchronous Model is an[[Event-driven Server]].

#### Other Scalability issues
→ **Data copying especially in network protocols**
	→ Use buffer descriptors (similar to java.nio.buffers) not simple pointers  
	→ Use scatter/gather I/O, e.g. readv()/writev()  
→ **Memory allocation default allocator is general purpose**  
	→ Design your own  
		- Which can pre-allocate a pool of memory buffers  
		- Avoid to free those buffers  
**Concurrency control**
	→ Avoid sharing (if possible, sometimes requires copying)  
		- Usually, you cannot avoid sharing memory buffers  
	→ Locking granularity:
		- Too coarse false sharing and unnecessary blocking  
		- Too fine grained may lead to deadlocks  
	→ Minimize the duration of critical sections  

**Kernel/protocol tuning**
