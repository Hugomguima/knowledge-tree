# Knowledge Discovery in Databases
Is the non-trivial process of identifying patterns in data
– implicit (by contrast to explicit)  
– valid (patterns should be valid on new data)  
– novel (novelty can be measured by comparing to expected values)  
– potentially useful (should lead to useful actions)  
– understandable (to humans)  

**Data Mining** is a step in the KDD process

## CRISP-DM
cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)  
- European Community funded effort  aiming to  
	– cheaper, faster, and more reliable data mining  
	– widespread adoption  
	– reduce skills required for data mining  
	– capture experience for reuse  
- characteristics  
	– non-proprietary  
	– application/industry neutral  
	– tool neutral  
	– focus on business issues  
- as well as technical analysis  
	– framework for guidance  
	– experience based  
- templates for analysis

## Last remarks
A data mining project should always start with an analysis of the data with traditional query tools
- 80% of the interesting information can be extracted using SQL
- 20% of hidden information requires more advanced techniques
